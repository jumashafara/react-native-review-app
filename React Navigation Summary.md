## Hello React Navigation

- React Native doesn't have a built-in API for navigation like a web browser does. React Navigation provides this for you, along with the iOS and Android gestures and animations to transition between screens.
- `Stack.Navigator` is a component that takes route configuration as its children with additional props for configuration and renders our content.
- Each `Stack.Screen` component takes a `name` prop which refers to the name of the route and `component` prop which specifies the component to render for the route. These are the 2 required props.
- To specify what the initial route in a stack is, provide an `initialRouteName` as the prop for the navigator.
- To specify screen-specific options, we can pass an `options` prop to `Stack.Screen`, and for common options, we can pass ``screenOptions` to `Stack.Navigator`

## Moving Between Screens Summaryâ€‹

- `navigation.navigate('RouteName')` pushes a new route to the native stack navigator if it's not already in the stack, otherwise it jumps to that screen.
- We can call `navigation.push('RouteName')` as many times as we like and it will continue pushing routes.
- The header bar will automatically show a back button, but you can programmatically go back by calling `navigation.goBack()`. On Android, the hardware back button just works as expected.
- You can go back to an existing screen in the stack with navigation.`navigate('RouteName')`, and you can go back to the first screen in the stack with `navigation.popToTop()`.
- The `navigation` prop is available to all screen components (components defined as screens in route configuration and rendered by React Navigation as a route).

## Passing Parameters to Routes

- `navigate` and `push` accept an optional second argument to let you pass parameters to the route you are navigating to. For example: `navigation.navigate('RouteName', { paramName: 'value' })`.
- You can read the params through `route.params` inside a screen
- You can update the screen's params with `navigation.setParams`
- Initial params can be passed via the `initialParams` prop on Screen
- Params should contain the minimal data required to show a screen, nothing more

## Customizing the header bar

- You can customize the header inside of the `options` prop of your screen components. Read the full list of options in the API reference.
- The `options` prop can be an object or a function. When it is a function, it is provided with an object with the `navigation` and `route` prop.
  You can also specify shared `screenOptions` in the stack navigator configuration when you initialize it. The prop takes precedence over that configuration
